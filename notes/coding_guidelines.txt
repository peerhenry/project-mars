# INTRODUCTION
Code may deviate in some places.


# RESOURCES
resources are prefixed as follows:
Resource	Prefix
Sprites		spr_
Scripts		scr_
Objects		obj_


# SCRIPTS

- script arguments are prefixed with arg_

- If a script requires coordinate parameters (either x,y or i,j), they are passed as the first arguments, ie:
var arg_x = argument0;
var arg_y = argument1;

- to avoid copying arrays on write, always use the character @ when writing to an array.
my_array[@22] = 139;
