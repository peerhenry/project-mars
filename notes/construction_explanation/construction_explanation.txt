### Terminology explanation for construction logic ###

There are a number of terms which have specific meaning in throughout the scripts for construction.
- build
- build tile
- build action
- build stack
- build cell
- construction queue
- construction
- construction cell


When the player clicks on the HUD to build something, the construction will be validated on the map while hovering.

The construction is set in the global "BUILD" variable.
Each BUILD has one or more "BUILD TILES".
A BUILD TILE contains the relative position to the origin of the construction in grid index coordinates.
Each BUILD TILE has one or more "BUILD ACTIONS".
A "BUILD ACTION" contains:
- The validations in order for action to be executed.
- The action to perform on the map_buffer.
- The object to add (and to which layer).
- The object that should be removed.

While the mouse hovers over the map, or the player is dragging the mouse, a "BUILD GHOST" is drawn that shows which BUILD TILES pass or fail validation.
A BUILD TILE passes validation if it has at least one BUILD ACTION that passes its validation.
If all BUILD TILES pass, the flag global.construction_is_valid, is set to true. Otherwise it is set to false.

While all BUILD TILES are being validated, the results are put on the BUILD STACK; For each BUILD TILE that can result in a executable action, a BUILD CELL 
is created and put on the BUILD STACK.

When the player releases the mouse on the map to do a construction and construction is valid, A number of things happen:
- A new CONSTRUCTION will be created and put on the BUILD QUEUE.
- The contents of the BUILD STACK will be read.
- For each BUILD CELL on the BUILD STACK, a CONSTRUCTION CELL will be created and associated with the new CONSTRUCTION
